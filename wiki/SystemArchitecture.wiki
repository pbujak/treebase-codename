== Description ==

 The _!TreeBaseEngine.exe_ creates a server process that can be running as an OS service (now inly Windows) or directly from command line (in practice only for testing). It contains a linked and loaded DLL _!TreeBaseCommon.dll_ that is responsible for communication.

 Each client process has loaded both DLLs; _!TreeBase.dll_ that implements the API and _!TreeBaseCommon.dll_.

 On current implementation only shared memory is used to communicate between server and clients. But the design of _!TreeBaseCommon.dll_ allows to introduce in future mechanisms to communicate via network (named pipes, sockets)
