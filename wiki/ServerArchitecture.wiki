==Description==

=== Storage Subsystem ===

 The storage subsystem handles the [FileFormat#Page_Layer page layer] for each storage. Each database file is treated as a separate storage unit. [#Junctions_Handling Junctions] are used to map all storages into the namespace. 
 Two storages are managed differently, than the ordinary storages related to files. The first storage is located in memory, it contains the [DatabaseStructure standard database sections]. These sections are volatile, so they are created each time, during the engine startup. The second is located in a temporary file. It is not mapped into namespace, but used internally for [ClientProgramming#Section_operations snapshots]. It is also prepared for future implementation of transactions.
 In case of file storage the separate thread is created for each file. It processes the requests of page loading into core cache of each storage unit. When the cache is full, the LRU pages are discarded, dirty discarded pages are stored in pre-write temporary file.

=== Segment Manager ===
 The segment manager is responsible for [FileFormat#Segment_Layer segment layer] handling. It translates in-segment relative pages numbers to absolute page numbers and _vice versa_, allocates space for new pages within segment, handles creation and deletion of segments.
