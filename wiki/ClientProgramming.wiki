=== Section operations ===

 To create a new section, use function {{{TBASE_CreateSection}}}. It must be created directly in parent section (See [DatabaseStructure database structure] to choose a suitable location). The name of new section must be shorter than 128 characters. Tha attribute can be {{{TBATTR_NOVALUES}}}, that means that section can have only subsections. Otherwise it can ontain values. The advantage of sections without values is that it can avoid sharing problem. 
 The user cen also pass the [SectronSecurity security attributes] parameter. It can be {{{NULL}}}, in this case is inherited from parent.

 When the given section already exists - it is open in _dynamic_ mode.
 The handle of of just open section is returned. It can be used to manipulate values or subsections of it. Handles of open sections are *local to threads*. To release the open section use function {{{TBASE_CloseSection}}}.

 In order the function {{{TBASE_CreateSection}}} open the existing section. In contrary to creation, the name parameter can be a path (not a single name) related to base section given also as parameter. If base is root, give reserved value {{{TBSECTION_ROOT}}} instead of handle.
