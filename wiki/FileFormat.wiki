== Introduction ==

The data of each file can be considered on 3 separate layers: 
 * binary
 * segment
 * section and BLOB

|| *Page* || Basic unit of data, that can be loaded or stored to file (2048 bytes) ||
|| *Segment* || Logical sequence of pages (not neccessarily adjacent), that can be understood as a file in file ||

Each layer can be treated by a black box by others.
