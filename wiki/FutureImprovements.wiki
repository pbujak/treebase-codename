== Transactions ==
 In current version of the database engine there is no support of professional transactions. Also ones who browse source code can functions {{{TStorage::beginTrans}}}, {{{TStorage::endTrans}}} and related. They appear to the naked eye, to do with transactions. But in fact _"transactions"_ in this sense are writing operations, that cannot interfere with the flushing mechanism. 

 The recommended way to implement transactions is to:
 * Implement a _transaction buffer_ that stores uncommited pages. They would be stored as mappings:
{{{
{databaseId,segmentId,pageId} -> data
}}}
 The transaction buffer data could be based on a segment in a [Server_Architecture#Storage_Subsystem temporary storage].
