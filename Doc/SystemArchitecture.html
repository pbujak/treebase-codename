It contains a linked and loaded DLL <i>TreeBaseCommon.dll</i> that is responsible for communication. 
</blockquote><blockquote>Each client process has loaded both DLLs; <i>TreeBase.dll</i> (that implements the API) and <i>TreeBaseCommon.dll</i>. 
</blockquote><blockquote>For each client thread, that uses API functions a conjugated thread in server space is created. 
</blockquote><p>  <blockquote>On current implementation only shared memory is used to communicate between server and clients. But the design of <i>TreeBaseCommon.dll</i> allows to introduce in future mechanisms to communicate via network (named pipes, sockets).
